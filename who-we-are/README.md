# Who We Are - 6/12/2019

## Guidelines

### HTML

- copy and paste from ' <div class="bio-wrapper"' to </script> "'

- change image link
  
  - please make the picture square-cropped; it'll make your life easier

- change h4 - bio name

- IF the person is a manager, include <p class="bio-title" or else delete it

- change author page

- change bio

### CSS

- copy and paste all the css 

- you will need to put this into "advanced options"

- if the Divi Builder says "Missing RBRACE" just put  a "}" before the CSS; the CSS does work but Divi Builder has that bug

- you can try putting this into the whole page's container, but if something doesn't align put the CSS for each indivdiual person's container
